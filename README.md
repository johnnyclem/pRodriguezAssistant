### Software requirements
- **2019-07-10-raspbian-buster-lite** is used as OS Linux distribution. I assume it should work on any newer(and previous as well) versions, but haven't tested it.<br>
- **ALSA** is used for sound subsystem.<br>
- **[Pocketsphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx)** is the core of the speech recognition. **[Sphinxbase](https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinxbase)** must be installed for pocketsphinx to work. I compiled both from the sources.<br>
- **CMU Flite** and **eSpeak** are used for Text to Speech purposes(Flite for English and eSpeak for Russian).<br>
- To control the backlight **[NeoPixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel)** must be installed(with all its dependencies).<br>
- **[Music Player Daemon (MPD)](https://www.musicpd.org/)** is the underlying music player(only to play the music, Bender's answers are playing with **aplay** utility from the ALSA package).
